## Installation

Here's how to install this mod:

- First, download `TriTriSim Hub.bat` from this repository, and place it into an empty folder.

- Next, run the file, select 2020, reopen, select 2024, and initialization is complete.

- Now, using `TriTriSim Hub.bat`, open the installer for your simulator, go to settings, and make sure the community folder is correct. If not, set it.

- Finally, go to the main menu of your sim-specific installer, select TFX, install the base package, and select any planes you need.

- You are done.
